My favorate game is The Elder Scroll V: Skyrim. It is an action RPG. It's the fifth main installment in The Elder Scrolls series. The reason I like it is because it created a massive fantasy open world that can let you travel and have experience in. It has it's own history and it's so detailed that you can even read book series inside the game. Beyond that, fan-created modifications are available and supported, which make the game keep alive till these days.

The game was developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published on Nov 11, 2011.
